# DS_Project_Churn
 This repository contains a project of machine learning related to predict the churn of a bank dataset (file available). The goal is to apply different machine learning techniques to upgrade churn prediction in other versions.

There files in in .ipynb format and contain Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), dataset treatments, feature and model selection. The intention is to keep improving the overall results, feature engineering and model selection in the next deploy versions.
